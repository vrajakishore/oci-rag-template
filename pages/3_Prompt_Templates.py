    ### Prompt Template Usage Guide:
    1. **Write Your Prompt**: Use the text area to draft your prompt. This can be a question, instruction, or any text you want to use as a template.
    2. **Save Your Prompt**: Click the "Save" button to store your prompt. It will be saved in the `saved_prompts` directory.
    3. **Edit or Delete Prompts**: You can edit existing prompts by clicking the "Edit" button next
       to each saved prompt.
       To delete a prompt, click the "Delete" button.
    4. **Use Saved Prompts**: Once saved, your prompts will be listed below the input area. You can click on any prompt to view its content, edit it, or delete it.
    5. **Default Templates**: The app comes with a set of default templates that you can use as a starting point. These templates are automatically saved in the `saved_prompts` directory.
    ### Tips:
    - Use clear and concise language in your prompts to ensure they are effective.
    - Regularly review and update your saved prompts to keep them relevant.
    - You can create prompts for various purposes, such as generating lesson plans, compliance checklists, or operational guidelines.
    ### Example Prompts:
    - "Generate a comprehensive lesson plan for new officers."
    - "What are the key licensing criteria under the relevant regulations?"
    - "Outline the steps for conducting on-site compliance audits at licensed venues."
    - "What responsible gambling measures must operators provide?"
